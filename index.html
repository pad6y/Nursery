                Welcome to Newcastle Daycare, situated in the beautiful
                surroundings of Elswick park. Our setting is a fully inclusive
                home from home, where all children are made to feel welcome. We
                allow the children freedom to play, explore and be themselves.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                At Newcastle Daycare we pride ourselves on the quality of care,
                which we provide to all of the children who attend our setting.
                We know quality of care is the most important factor for parents
                and carers when selecting a day care provision. Our highly
                qualified staff strive to ensure that all children feel happy,
                safe and secure. Safety and welfare are our top priority.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Our outdoor area holds access to Elswick park, creating a
                peaceful and stimulating environment for the children to explore
                and investigate. There is an abundance of resources on offer
                which caters for all of the children’s different needs and
                interests.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                We encourage parents and carers to be interested and involved in
                your child’s day at nursery. The use of a secure online learning
                journey allows us to record and track your child’s development.
                This ensures parents/carers have access to observations,
                photographs and a contact with your child’s key worker.

              All of our staff at Newcastle Daycare are highly qualified with

              qualifications with hands on work based experience. Many of our
              staff team are parents themselves which adds a strong element of
              empathy and understanding towards our children and their families.
              All of our staff team have been recruited via the safer
              recruitment scheme with relevant DBS (Disclosure and barring
              service) checks.

              At Newcastle Daycare we engage the children in regular outings,

              encouraged to choose their own healthy snacks and resources they
              may wish to play with. We also provide opportunities for the
              children to attend outings further afield, for example an outing
              to the farm, where the children learn about animals and
              agriculture, giving them a better understanding of the world
              through first hand experiences.

              The children at Newcastle Daycare will work closely with our local
              community, engaging in fun and exciting charitable events
              throughout the year. We also have contact with a local care home
              where the children will engage in activities alongside senior
              residents. This interaction of juniors and seniors holds many
              benefits for example; boosting self confidence, increase in
              communication and language, learning new skills, and giving all
              parties a sense of purpose.

                  5 Diploma in Leadership for Children and young people's
                  services and have 15 years experience in child care. Out of
                  those 15 years, I have worked alongside Katie for 10 years,
                  progressing from an apprentice to management in my previous
                  roles. I am also a mum to my son Leighton, who was born in
                  November 2018. Working with children has been my passion since
                  I started my career 15 years ago, supporting children with the
                  best start in life, helping them learn and grow to reach their
                  full potential and getting them school ready. I love outdoor
                  learning and free flow sessions where the children have access
                  to all areas, so that they can investigate and explore, using
                  their imagination and being at one with the natural world.

                  Firstly I would like to thank you for taking time to read all
                  about our team. I am a mother of two; My son is 11yrs and has
                  complex needs, I have therefore completed many additional
                  courses and been involved in outside agencies and
                  professionals- learning to live in every child’s little world
                  is upmost priority. My daughter 8yrs is full of humour and
                  always by my side. My work ethic; 20yrs experience in
                  childcare it was always my dream. I have an honours degree in
                  childcare and always continue my professional development to
                  understand every child and their needs. I believe children
                  boost enthusiasm and bring laughter to each and everyone of
                  us. Every child is unique and I love to enhance their
                  individual learning opportunities. Outdoors is my favourite
                  place we capture children in a whole new perspective. Louise
                  and I are like family having worked together for over 10
                  years. Lastly … I personally have managed nurseries for over a
                  decade and it is still my absolute goal to continue, I
                  couldn’t believe in a better opportunity other than to reach
                  this goal with Louise and her family too. We are therefore a
                  family run business looked after one another’s children in
                  previous provisions and can not wait to observe your
                  children’s learning journeys and build a relationship with you
                  all. We appreciate your time and can not wait to hopefully
                  meet you and your families one day soon.

                  My name is Demi and I am currently working on completing my
                  apprenticeship in child care, learning and development. I have
                  1 year of experience through my previous work placement in a
                  childcare setting, which inspired me to enrol on my
                  apprenticeship. I love working with children, building
                  relationships and supporting them in their learning and
                  development by providing fun and exciting activities.
